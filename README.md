# Evaluating Customer Segmentation Model using K-Fold Cross-Validation

This project focuses on evaluating a machine learning model applied to customer data using **K-Fold Cross-Validation**. It helps estimate the model's performance more reliably by splitting the dataset into multiple folds.

## Objective

- Apply K-Fold Cross-Validation to the customer dataset to evaluate model performance.
- Ensure the model generalizes well and is not overfitting to any specific subset of data.
- Compare fold-wise accuracy to assess stability.

## Dataset

**File Name:** customers.csv

The dataset includes information such as:
- Age
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- Other customer features relevant for segmentation or prediction

## Concepts Covered

- K-Fold Cross-Validation
- Model Evaluation and Resampling
- Bias-Variance Tradeoff
- Accuracy Estimation across Folds
- Generalization Performance

## Workflow Summary

1. Load the customer dataset.
2. Preprocess and select features for modeling.
3. Choose a supervised or unsupervised model (e.g., classification, regression, clustering with scoring).
4. Apply K-Fold Cross-Validation:
   - Split data into *k* equal folds
   - Train the model on *k-1* folds
   - Validate on the remaining fold
   - Repeat *k* times and compute the average performance
5. Analyze fold-wise results and draw conclusions.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Conclusion

K-Fold Cross-Validation ensures the customer segmentation model is validated in a balanced and robust way. This approach helps assess how well the model is expected to perform on unseen customer data.
